## Baton Trajectory
This program plots the trajectory of a spinning baton. The controllable parameters are its starting velocity, starting angle and starting angular velocity. It also plots the potential and kinetic energy in Joules with respect to time. This is an exercise in a textbook by Landau (2015)[^1].
